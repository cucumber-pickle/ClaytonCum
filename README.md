## Configuration
Create a config.json file in the root directory with the following structure:
   ```json
{
    "use_proxy": true,
    "complete_task": false,
    "play_games": ["clayball", "stack"],
    "clayball_score": [15, 160],
    "play_game": true,
    "game_ticket_to_play": 2,
    "account_delay": 5,

## How to fill the data.txt
Add a query.txt file containing the login information (e.g., tokens or other necessary data). Each line should represent a separate account.

4. at the top of the choose "`Application`" 
5. then select "`Session Storage`"

You can add more and run the accounts in turn by entering a query id in new line like this:
```txt
query_id=xxxxxxxxx-Rxxxxujhash=cxxx
query_id=xxxxxxxxx-Rxxxxujhash=cxxxx
```


10. **Create a `proxies.txt` file**

    The `proxies.txt` file should be in the root directory and contain a list of proxies in the format `username:password@host:port`.

    Example:

    ```
    user1:pass1@ip1:port1
    user2:pass2@ip2:port2
    ```

after that run the Banana bot by writing the command

## Usage
To run the script, simply execute:

   ```bash
python main.py
   ```
The script will start processing each account listed in query.txt, performing all configured operations.
